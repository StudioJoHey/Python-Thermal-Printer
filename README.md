The files are a fork from adafruit's Python-Thermal-Printer. The main goal of the project is to create a link between the digital public local sphere and the analog public sphere / space in a neighbouhood. The motivation behind this is to support and maintain a local narritive to stenghten the neighbourhoods' identity and connect people without any thresholds.
